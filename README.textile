== qresource

qresource is very much a work-in-progress. as of 0.0.3 it only supports GET's

sample usage:

*code* 

	<pre>

	class Qsample < Qresource::Base
	  attr_accessor :test
	end
	@sample_client = Qsample.new :api_url => 'http://gottfolk.se/qresource'
	@samples = @sample_client.all
	@first_sample = @sample_client.get(1)
	@first_sample.test
	# => "sample string" 

	</pre>


Base uses Hash.from_xml which can be quite... not so fast. but just override
the from_xml method, it takes one argument which is the libxml node.
