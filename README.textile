== qresource

qresource is very much a work-in-progress. as of 0.0.1 it only supports GET's

sample usage:

*code* 

	class Qsample < Qresource::Base
	  attr_accessor :test

	  def initialize( *args ) # {{{
		 p = args.first
		 p.symbolize_keys!
		 unless p[:login].blank?
			@login = p[:login]
			@password = p[:password]
			@api_url = p[:api_url]
			return
		 end 
		 @test = p[:test]
	  end # }}}

	end
